# Optimization-Techniques

### Description
This collection of scripts was created for the scope of an assignment in a Optimization-Techniques cource of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki during the 2019-20 academic year. The main purpose of these projects is to give some intuition about how some famous multivariate minimization algorithms work.

### Algorithms

#### Part 1: Uncostrained Single Variable Optimization
 - Bisection Method
 - Golden Section Method
 - Fibonacci Method
 - Bisection Derivative Method


#### Part 2: Uncostrained Multivariate Optimization
 - Steepest Descent Method
 - Newton's Method
 - Levenberg-Marquardt Method
 - Conjugate Gradients Method
 - Quasi Newton Method

#### Part 3: Costrained Multivariate Optimization
 - Barrier Method
 - Penalty Method

#### Project: Genetic Algorithm Implementation (Constrained Minimization Problem)
Minimize Traffic of a road network, given constant or variable input vehicle flow. 
Genetic Operations implemented:
 - Selection
 - Crossover
 - Mutation
 - Elitism

### Setup
The provided code is created using MATLAB R2019a, however older MATLAB versions should work fine. All of the .m scripts provided, are  commented for higher readability and maintenance.
