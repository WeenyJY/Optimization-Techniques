# Optimization-Techniques

### Description
This collection of scripts was created for the scope of an assignment in a Optimization-Techniques cource of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki during the 2019-20 academic year. The main purpose of these projects is to give some intuition about how some famous multivariate minimization algorithms work.
